# Examples

The examples can be run two different ways

### Directly

Most examples are simple Python programs that define a grammar and parse some strings. They will throw an exception and error-out if parsing failed. You can run them directly. 

    python examples/antler_grammar.py

> Be sure you are in the `pyparsing` project directory, not the `example` directory

### Test Suite

The test suite can run the examples for you
